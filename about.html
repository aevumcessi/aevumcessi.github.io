    <p>Hi! I'm Elaine. I am currently a second-year Computer Science and Writing Seminars double major at Johns Hopkins University. In my free time, I enjoy writing short fiction, reading my way through the Man Booker finalists, and watching contemporary meme television. On campus, I am a part of the Eclectics dance group, the HopHacks organizing team, ACM, and WiCS. I also dabble in the art of pretending I know how to cook, which is not actually possible in any college dorm kitchenâ€”you can view my many attempts <a href="http://instagram.com/shittycollegecooking">here</a>.</p></br>
    <p>This website was made possible by the JHU ACM's Intersession 2017 Web Dev Workshop. God bless ACM.</p>
